                                        I am a life-long long learner with a passion for data, coding and creating exciting visualizations.  Learning new skills, mastering applications and learning a coding language are awesome.

    I am a very loyal person who will alway try to make my employer look good.

    <p> 
    When it comes to data problems, I am fairly fearless and believe every problem has a solution, the question usually is whether the solution is worth the cost in resources.  When looking for solutions, no stone will be left unturned... searched stones are even marked as not to waste time researching them!

                                       This was a fun, challenging position that made me realize how much I <b>loved data, programming and creating visualizations</b>.  I was part of a small (about 10 members), inter-nationally renowned team of data specialist who managed one of the largest archives of over 500 meteorological and oceanographic datasets.  
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Each team member had a collection of datasets for which they are responsible.  Because we were a small team, that meant each member was responsible for <b>all</b> aspects of the data.  This included quality control, meta-data and document creation, all web interfaces, end-user assistance, visualization creation and so on.  Some data was stored and served from a MySQL database, so it was also necessary to design, create and maintain all aspects of the database, including creating both the front end and back end code necessary to provide access to end users.  
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        One of my primary functions was a large project to homogenize over 50 streams of data into 1 data flow, with all duplicates removed.  This was a huge challenge and I was the only person working on this project.  This required developing many new methods to ascertain quality and integrity.  Much of the earlier data  suffered from precision loss due to bit loss and rounding problems from being processed on computer systems in the 1960's and 1970's.  Some of the data was also key-entered from hand-written logs and dated as far back as the 1920's.  Another issue was duplicates were very hard to identify because of the precision loss noted above.  
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Much of the data was very rare, with our group being the only experts (because of the age of the data).  This meant there was little to no guidance on how to solve many issues, so we had to be become very creative in our analysis techniques and in creating solutions.  In some cases, new types of visualization were created or at least new ways to view the analyses.

                                        I subsequently became a Learning Assistant and Tutor for the class.  In July, 2020, I became a substitute Instructor.

                                        My wife and I started this non-profit to get kids excited about science and technology and show them the wonderful opportunities they provide. We have held many science and technology workshops, working with kids of all ages.

                                        I taught Algebra I to 3 block classes, which meant each class was 1.5 hour long.  These classes did not have a teacher until I was hired on October 17 (about 2 months).
